          <h3>Jonah</h3>
          <p>Meet Jonah, a big, handsome boy estimated to be 6 to 8 years old. Jonah was surrendered because he was having issues with the bigger dogs in the house. He seems to be fine with other dogs out in public but can get jealous of other dogs in his home and become aggressive, so he will probably need to be an only dog. Jonah loves all people and attention, and other than needing to lose some weight, he is healthy, happy boy.</p>

          <h3>Soprano</h3>
          <p>Meet Soprano! He is a beautiful 10 year old black pug, who came into rescue with Bella but they can be adopted separately. He's a fantastic pug. His foster home reports that he gets along with everyone, is very welll behaved, is great on a leash and loves chasing tennis balls. He is also the sweetest boy who ADORES being cuddled and carried...he even gives you hugs when you pick him up. He would fit in with pretty much any type of home.</p>

          <h3>Remington is ready for his forever home!</h3>
          <p>I'm Remington (Remi for short), and I have a lot to be thankful for this holiday season. I was hit by a car (that's not the part I'm thankful for), but then I was turned over to <abbr title="Southern Nevada Pug Rescue">SNPR</abbr> to make sure I get the care I need. The car accident left me very bruised and with road rash all over. I also have a very bad knee, and I heard the vet tell <abbr title="Southern Nevada Pug Rescue">SNPR</abbr> that it is the same grade as a pug named Bleu's was and that I will need surgery for a luxating patella. But <abbr title="Southern Nevada Pug Rescue">SNPR</abbr> said "we fixed Bleu up, and we'll get you fixed up too!" and gave me a kiss. I knew I had landed in a good place. I also need a dental, and my vision is limited...however, I'm extremely sweet and good natured. I really like to cuddle, and I get around fine. I'm about 8 years old, and I'm already making my holiday wish list-to find a great family! I will need to go back to the vet in a couple weeks after I am less sore to see when I need my surgeries, so please consider making a donation, because I know it will be expensive and they have lots of pugs to save this holiday season!</p>

        <h3>Frankie</h3>
        <p>Meet Frankie a 6&ndash;7 yr old full of energy chunky monkey! Frankie recently came into the rescue due to his owner having a change of plans in their life that did not include Frankie. He is a sweet, loving pug that gets along with other dogs, pugs and animals. Frankie loves people and wants to be your best friend ;-) Won't you consider this beautifully chunky monkey to be the addition to your family?</p>

        <p>Jordy is a black female pug, estimated to be 6 to 8 years old. She loves to sit on laps and is docile with other dogs.</p>
        <p class="update">Jordy is doing great in her foster home. SNPR believes she is closer to 8 to 10, however she looks and acts much younger. She's sweet, gives kisses, is crate trained, and sits for treats. You won't regret adding this beautiful girl to your family!</p>

        <h3>Scooby</h3>
        <p>Scooby is a big handsome hunk of a pug! He's got a gorgeous face and wrinkles. He's estimated to be about 6 years old and is sweet and easy going. He has an ear infection that we are clearing up and then he'll make someone a great addition to their family.</p>
        <p class="update">Scooby is a great pug. He's settling into his foster home great. He seems to prefer men, but likes everyone. He is definitely on a diet (he's a big boy!) so he's on the prescription weight food but he enjoys walks so he should lose weight pretty easily. <abbr title="Southern Nevada Pug Rescue">SNPR</abbr> was told he had been thrown out of a car at one point in his life, and he has a bit of a limp but it doesn't bother him.</p>
