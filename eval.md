Assigned a WordPress assignment with an obvious lack of knowledge about WordPress. Glossed over it in 2 weeks, when learning anything about WordPress would take much longer than that for a beginner.

The end result: we learned nothing of substance about WordPress and wasted two weeks.

He was always asking a student questions that he really should know. I don't know how anybody learns much of anything in the class.
