Bio:(1 of the 3 photographers in the exhibit)
Hi! I’m the Scott Roeben that will be part of the Beyond the Neon photo exhibit. I wanted to send along a short blurb, which I realize is redundant, or at least should be. I’m almost entirely clueless about what these blurbs should say, but here’s my best guess:

Scott Roeben is a Las Vegas-based photographer, and member of the Las Vegas Photographic Society, a local photography group dedicated to “paying it forward.” While specializing in children’s photography, Scott recently began taking portraits of the homeless on Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. Inspired by San Francisco photographer Thomas Hawk’s “$2 Portrait Project,” Scott responds to panhandling with the response, “No problem. I’m doing $2 portraits. Mind if I take yours?” This simple interaction has led to a greater appreciation of the plight of the city’s homeless, and the development of a photographic collection that seeks to inspire compassion, and compassionate acts, for those living on our streets. Scott is a marketing copywriter for Harrah’s Entertainment, and volunteers with a number of charities, including Spread the Word Nevada (children’s literacy) and Operation Love: Reunited (providing free portraits for military families before, during and after deployments).

How’s that on length? Do photographers include their equipment info. in these things? Anything else?

If there are further questions, I am at 561-7028.

Thanks,
Scott
